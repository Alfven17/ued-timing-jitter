https://journals.aps.org/prab/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevAccelBeams.28.024001

The AD implementation requires [jax](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax) and [diffrax](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/diffrax), and DA implementation requires [pyaudi](https://github.com/darioizzo/audi) and [desolver](https://github.com/Microno95/desolver).
